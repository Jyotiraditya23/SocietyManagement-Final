## What this is

This is a comprehensive society management platform designed for Nehete Society (~40 flats). This system handles **complaint tracking, notices, maintenance payments, and general administration** to streamline communication and resolve issues. 

- Residents log complaints with optional description categories and photos, and track the status.
- Admins/Managers assign priorities, update statuses, and log detailed notes for each action.
- Every status transition is logged in an append-only timeline.
- Open complaints that exceed a configurable day threshold are flagged dynamically as overdue and surfaced to the top of the admin view.
- Pinned important notices generate transactional email broadcasts to all residents.

## 📝 Complaint & Notice Board Features

- **Residents Portal:** Register, log in, view/create complaints, upload photos, and read notice board posts.
- **Complaint Lifecycle:** Track transitions through `open` ➔ `in-progress` ➔ `resolved`. A detailed history logs timestamps and acting users for every change.
- **Admin Triage:** Filter complaints by category, status, flat number, or date. Update complaint status and priority level (`low`, `medium`, `high`).
- **Dynamic Overdue Pinning:** Complaints remaining open past a configurable number of days (defined under settings, e.g., 3 days) are flagged as overdue and automatically sorted to the top of the admin dashboard.
- **Notice Board:** Post notices, optionally marking them as `is_important` to pin them and send email alerts to all residents.
- **Email Notifications:** Transactional emails automatically notify residents when their complaint status changes or when important notices are posted.
- **Metrics Dashboard:** View metrics on complaint statuses, complaint categories, and total overdue counts.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20.x LTS or newer
- npm 10.x or newer
- MongoDB database (local or Atlas cluster)
- Brevo account (for mail transactions)
- ImageKit account (for photo uploads)

### 1. Clone and Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AAYUSH412/Society-Management-System.git
cd Society-Management-System

# Install client dependencies
cd client && npm install

# Install server dependencies
cd ../server && npm install
```

### 2. Set Up Environment Variables

Configure your local environments. Copy the example configurations and edit the variables with your keys:

```bash
# In the server directory
cp .env.example .env.local

# In the client directory
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Refer to [server/.env.example](./server/.env.example) and [client/.env.example](./client/.env.example) for variable descriptions and placeholders.

### 3. Run Locally

Ensure MongoDB is running, then start the dev servers:

```bash
# Start backend (defaults to http://localhost:4000)
cd server && npm run dev

# Start frontend (defaults to http://localhost:3000)
cd client && npm run dev
```

*Note: On your first run, navigate to `/manager-setup` on the client to register the primary Manager account. You can then invite or register other roles.*
